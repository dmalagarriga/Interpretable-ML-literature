> Abstract: We propose a method for building an interpretable recommender system for
personalizing online content and promotions. Historical data available for the
system consists of customer features, provided content (promotions), and user
responses. Unlike in a standard multi-class classification setting,
misclassification costs depend on both recommended actions and customers. Our
method transforms such a data set to a new set which can be used with standard
interpretable multi-class classification algorithms. The transformation has the
desirable property that minimizing the standard misclassification penalty in
this new space is equivalent to minimizing the custom cost function.
