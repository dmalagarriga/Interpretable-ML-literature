> Abstract: We propose a method for building an interpretable recommender system for
personalizing online content and promotions. Historical data available for the
system consists of customer features, provided content (promotions), and user
responses. Unlike in a standard multi-class classification setting,
misclassification costs depend on both recommended actions and customers. Our
method transforms such a data set to a new set which can be used with standard
interpretable multi-class classification algorithms. The transformation has the
desirable property that minimizing the standard misclassification penalty in
this new space is equivalent to minimizing the custom cost function.

> Abstract: We consider the problem of generating interpretable recommendations by identifying overlapping co-clusters of clients and products, based only on positive or implicit feedback. Our approach is applicable on very large datasets because it exhibits almost linear complexity in the input examples and the number of co-clusters. We show, both on real industrial data and on publicly available datasets, that the recommendation accuracy of our algorithm is competitive to that of state-of-art matrix factorization techniques. In addition, our technique has the advantage of offering recommendations that are textually and visually interpretable. Finally, we examine how to implement our technique efficiently on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).
